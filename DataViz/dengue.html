        <div class="introduction">
            <p>
                Dengue is a viral infection caused by one of four closely related dengue viruses.
                It is spread to humans by the Aedes mosquito, which also spreads the Zika and Chikungunya viruses.
                Dengue fever is common in tropical and subtropical climates across the world,
                particularly in urban and semi-urban settings. Dengue symptoms normally develop 4-7 days after infection
                and can range from minor to severe. Mild dengue fever symptoms include a high fever, headache,
                joint and muscular discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. Dengue can cause dengue hemorrhagic fever,
                which is characterized by bleeding from the nose, gums, or beneath the skin and can be deadly if not
                treated rapidly. <br> <br>

                Today, we will visualize the dataset given by Sir Paul Bokingkito. <br><br>

                First, we need to import the necessary dependencies for this project.
            
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Now, the dataset got loaded successfully but we want to 
            delete the first row as it will just cause errors later.
            To do that we have to run this code:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            <pre><code class="language-python">
                data.drop([0], inplace = True)

        <p>
            The first row has been successfully removed. <br>
            Now, we want to check if there are missing values in our dataset.
            To do that, we want to run the code below:
        </p>

        <div class="code">

        <p>
            Since there is only one missing value in the column <code class="language-python">['deaths']</code>, i'm going to drop it.
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            <pre><code class="language-python">

        <p>
            We want to know the dataypes of each column in our dataset.
            I want to change the datatype of the column <code class="language-python">['cases']</code> and <code class="language-python">['deaths']</code> into numeric data types.
            I also want to change the datatype of <code class="language-python">['date']</code> to datetime so that I can freely manipulate it

            Our next step is to clean the dataset first because there might be outliers,
            and our machine learning model won't be that efficient if we won't clean the dataset.
            In this project, i want to use the mean and standard deviation to set boundaries,
            and drop those values below our lower limit and above our upper limit.
            <br>
            <br>
            We first need to get the descriptive statistics of our dataset.
        </p>

        <p>
            As we can see in the ['cases'] column, the mean value is very far from the maximum value.
            That typically means that there are some extreme values, or outliers,
            in the data set that are skewing the overall distribution.
            The mean is sensitive to outliers and can be significantly affected by their presence,
            while the maximum value is not. <br><br>
            Let us try to display a boxplot to visually see our outliers.
        </p>

        <div class="code">

        <p>
            As we can see, there are so many outliers. Let's try to clean the column ['cases'].
            To do that, we just need to run the code below.
        </p>


        <div class="code">
            <pre><code class="language-python">
                upper_limit= data['cases'].mean() + 3 * data['cases'].std ()

                data = data[(data['cases'] < upper_limit) & (data['cases'] > lower_limit)]
                data.plot(kind='box', subplots=True, layout=(3,3), sharex=False, sharey=False, figsize=(15,8))

            I think this is enough to make our analysis.

        <p>
            Since our dataset has been cleaned of any inaccuracies,
            inconsistencies or missing values, we can now begin visualizing and analyzing it.
            This means that we can start to make sense of the data by creating graphical representations

        <p>
            The Pearson correlation result of the columns ['deaths'] and ['cases'] is -0.011422.
            This means that there is a small, negative linear relationship between the two variables being analyzed.
            A value of -0.011422 would indicate a very weak negative correlation between the two variables.
            This means that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases, but the correlation is very weak.
            A value close to 0 indicates that there is no correlation between the two variables.<br><br>
            We need to the date to datetime since it's in object datatype. Converting an object to datetime
            is necessary when working with date or time data in a data analysis or data manipulation project.
            Additionally, converting an object to datetime allows the data to be sorted and filtered based on
            date and time values. This can be very useful in certain data analysis tasks such as identifying
            patterns or trends over time.
            To do that, we just need to run this code:
        </p>


        <div class="code">
            <pre><code class="language-python">
                data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])

            As we can see, when looking at the data, the year 2019 has the highest number of reported cases of dengue fever.
            This trend is a cause for concern and highlights the need for further research and action to 
            address the issue of dengue fever. It's important to note that the
            factors that contributed to this increase such as weather conditions, population density,
            and other factors need to be studied in order to come up with effective solutions and preventative measures.

            As we can see from the lineplot, the highest reported cases of dengue occurred in October 2019.
            This suggests that the incidence of dengue fever was particularly high during this time period.
            The spike in cases may be due to a variety of factors such as increased mosquito breeding,
            increased human-mosquito contact, or a higher level of viral circulation in the population.
            <br><br> On the other hand, the lowest reported cases of dengue took place in May 2020 and January 2021.
            This indicates that the incidence of dengue fever was particularly low during these time periods.
            The decrease in cases may be attributed to a variety of factors such as a decrease in mosquito breeding,
            decrease in human-mosquito contact, or the implementation of effective control measures.

            <br><br> It's important to note that the number of reported cases of dengue can fluctuate due
            to a variety of reasons such as changes in weather, mosquito control efforts, and population movement.
            Additionally, the number of reported cases doesn't necessarily reflect the true number of cases,
            as many cases of dengue are mild and go unreported.

            We can observe that the number of dengue deaths is not significant compared to the number of reported cases.
            However, a noticeable spike in deaths is visible during September and October of 2016, 2017 and 2018,

            As we can see from the barplot, the Central Luzon has the highest number of reported cases of dengue,
            when compared to other regions in the country. This suggests that the incidence of dengue fever is
            particularly high in this region. The high number of cases could be due to a variety of factors
            such as a higher population density, increased urbanization, and inadequate mosquito control measures.
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, BARMM has the lowest cases of Dengue.

            From the heatmap generated, we can see that the darkest shade of orange
            is the intersection of 9 and 2019, which means September 2019 has the highest number of
            occurrences or highest value in the data set.

            The results generated above show that there is a significant 
            trend of dengue fever cases in the Philippines, particularly in 2019 with the 
            highest reported cases in October of that year. The data also shows that the 
            Central Luzon region has the highest number of reported cases of dengue fever 
            compared to other regions in the country, which could be due to a higher
            population density, increased urbanization, and inadequate mosquito control
            measures. It is important to note that the number of reported cases of dengue 
            can fluctuate due to various reasons and that the number of reported cases 
            doesn't necessarily reflect the true number of cases. The data also shows 
            that the number of dengue deaths is not significant compared to the number 
            of reported cases, however, there is a noticeable spike in deaths during 
            September and October of 2016, 2017 and 2018, which coincides with the rainy 
            season in the Philippines.
            Overall, the results generated highlight the importance of taking action and implementing effective preventative
            measures to address the issue of dengue fever in the Philippines.
